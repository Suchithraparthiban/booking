    <P class="history"><B><i>HISTORY</i></B></P>
    <P><h3>Born on 14 April 1891 in a village named Mhow in the Indore district of Madhya Pradesh, Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was also known as Babasaheb Ambedkar. His father Ramji Sakpal, was in the Indian Army, serving the country. With his good work, he was ranked as Subedar in the army. His mother's name was Bhima bai. From the beginning, Ramji encouraged his children to study and to work hard, due to which Bhimrao Ambedkar was fond of studies since childhood. However, he belonged to the Mahar caste, and people belonging to this caste were also called untouchables at that time. The meaning of untouchable was that if any belonging of the upper castes was touched by the people of the lower caste, it was considered impure and the people of the upper caste would not use those things.

    Even the children belonging to the lower caste could not go to school for studies due to the poor thinking of the society. Fortunately, the government ran a special school for the children of all the employees working in the army, so B. R. Ambedkar's early education could be possible. Despite being good at studies, he along with all the lower caste children accompanying him were seated outside the class or in the corner of the class. The teachers there also paid little attention to them. These children were not allowed to even touch the tap to drink water. The peon of the school used to pour water on his hands from afar and then they used to get water to drink. When the peon was not there, they had to study and go without water, despite being thirsty.</h3></P>

    <P class="history"><B>EMETRGING AS AN POLITICIAN</B></P>
    <P><h2></h2>In 1936, Ambedkar founded the Independent Labour Party which later contested the Central Assembly elections and won 15 seats. Between 1941 and 1945 he published several books, like ‘Thoughts in Pakistan’. In this book, the demand for creating a separate country for Muslims was strongly opposed. Ambedkar's vision of India was different. He wanted to see the whole country without falling apart, which is why he strongly criticized the policies of the leaders who wanted to divide ​​India. After India's independence on 15 August 1947, Ambedkar became the first law minister and despite his deteriorating health, he gave a strong law to India. Then his written constitution came into force on 26 January 1950, and in addition to this, the Reserve Bank of India was established with the views of Bhimrao Ambedkar. After all, while struggling with political issues, Bhimrao Ambedkar's health deteriorated day by day, and then on 6 December 1956, he passed away. He had changed the thinking of the society to a great extent, he ensured that Dalits and women get their rights.</h2></P>
