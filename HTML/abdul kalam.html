            <B><i><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3></i></B>
            Abdul Kalam, full name Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was an eminent Indian scientist and politician who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam was widely referred to as the "People's President" due to his humble demeanor and popularity among the masses.
    Kalam played a crucial role in India's space and missile development programs. He served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) during his illustrious career. One of his most significant contributions was his pivotal role in the development of India's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs.
    
    Despite his stature as a scientist, Kalam was known for his down-to-earth personality and his ability to connect with people of all ages and backgrounds, especially the youth. He was a passionate advocate for science education and often spoke at schools and colleges to inspire young minds.

    After his presidency, Kalam continued to be actively involved in various educational and charitable initiatives. He was a prolific author, writing several books on topics ranging from technology and education to inspirational anecdotes.
    
    Abdul Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. His death was mourned across the nation, and he was widely remembered for his contributions to science, education, and the overall development of India. Kalam's legacy continues to inspire millions of people around the world.
    
    <B><h3><i>PERSONAL LIFE</i></h3></B>
    From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.

    A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, 2007.
    In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing President Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India’s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s first woman president.
    
    Upon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed to using science and technology to transform India into a developed country and served as a lecturer at several universities. On July 27, 2015, he collapsed while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong and was pronounced dead from cardiac arrest soon afterward.
    <B><H3><i>AWARDS</i></H3></B>
    On January 23, 2024, the president’s office announced that Karpoori Thakur, socialist leader and chief minister of the state of Bihar twice in the 1970s, will posthumously receive the country’s highest civilian honor. During his term as chief minister, Thakur worked for marginalized groups and brought in “reservations,” or affirmative action programs, for “other backward classes” (OBCs), a term used by the Indian government for groups that are educationally or socially marginalized. The president’s announcement came a day before Thakur’s birth centenary. On February 3 the president’s office and Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that Lal Krishna Advani, former deputy prime minister of India, a founding member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), will be conferred the Bharat Ratna. Then, on February 9, the president’s office and the prime minister announced three more Bharat Ratna awards (posthumous) for the year—geneticist and administrator Monkombu Sambasivan Swaminathan as well as Congress leader Pamulaparti Venkata Narasimha Rao and independence activist and political leader Chaudhuri Charan Singh, both of whom were former prime ministers of India—making this a year when the highest number of Bharat Ratna awards have been declared. Swaminathan is recognized for his role in India’s green revolution, increasing the yield of wheat and rice in the country and moving India toward self-sufficiency in food production; Rao made efforts to liberalize India’s economy in the early 1990s; and Charan Singh was an independence activist who served briefly as prime minister from 1979 to 1980.
